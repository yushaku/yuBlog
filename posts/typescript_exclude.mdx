## Extract a member of a discriminated union by discriminator

Given a discriminated union, like **Event** below, you often need to be able to access a single member of the union.

This can feel like an obscure problem, until you realize that **Extract** is the perfect tool for the job.

Here, we're extracting the **ClickEvent**  type from the  **Event**:

```typescript
type Event =
  | {
      type: "click";
      x: number;
      y: number;
    }
  | {
      type: "focus";
    }
  | {
      type: "blur";
    };

type ClickEvent = Extract<Event, { type: "click" }>;
type ClickEvent = {
  type: "click";
  x: number;
  y: number;
};
```

We pass **Event**  as the first argument to  **Extract**, and then we pass the shape of the member we want to extract as the second argument.

Crucially, we don't need to pass the entire member to **Extract**, just the shape we want to match. Beautiful.

## Extract a member of a discriminated union by shape

Sometimes, we want to extract a specific member of a discriminated union based on its shape, rather than its discriminator.

Let's go back to our **Event** type we declared earlier:

```typescript
type Event =
  | {
      type: "mousedown";
      x: number;
      y: number;
    }
  | {
      type: "mouseup";
      x: number;
      y: number;
    }
  | {
      type: "blur";
    };
```

Instead of extracting a member based on its discriminator, let's say we want to extract a member that has an **x**  property of type  **number**.

We can provide `{ x: number }` as the shape to match:

```typescript
type ClickEvent = Extract<Event, { x: number }>;
type ClickEvent =
  | {
      type: "mousedown";
      x: number;
      y: number;
    }
  | {
      type: "mouseup";
      x: number;
      y: number;
    };
```

The result is the **ClickEvent**  type, which is the member of the  **Event**  union that has an  **x**  property of type  **number**. In this case, since both the  **mousedown**  and  **mouseup**  members have an  **x**  property, the  **ClickEvent** type will be a union of these two members.

## Extract all strings/booleans/numbers from a union

Let's consider a union type that includes a mix of strings, booleans, and numbers:

```typescript
type PossibleValues = "admin" | "user" | "guest" | true | false | 1 | 2 | 3;
```

To extract all the string members from this union, we can use `Extract<PossibleValues, string>`:

```typescript
type Strings = Extract<PossibleValues, string>;
type Strings = "admin" | "user" | "guest";
```

The result will be the **Strings**  type, which is a union of all the string members ("admin", "user", and "guest") in the  **PossibleValues** union.

## Extract all functions from a union

Let's say we have a union type that includes a mix of strings, numbers, booleans, and functions:

```typescript
type PossibleValues = string | number | boolean | (() => void);
```

To extract all the function members from this union, we can use `Extract<PossibleValues, (...args: any\[\]) => any>`:

```typescript
type Functions = Extract<
        type Functions = () => void  PossibleValues,
  (...args: any[]) => any
>;
```

**(...args: any\[\]) => any** effectively matches any function type - so we can use it to extract all the function members from the union.

In this case, the **Functions** type will only contain the **() => void** function type.

## Exclude null and undefined from a union

There are times when we want to exclude certain types from a union. We may have a union type that includes **null**  and  **undefined**, but we want to create a new type that excludes those values.

```typescript
type PossibleValues = string | number | boolean | null | undefined;
```

To exclude **null**  and  **undefined**  from  **PossibleValues**, we can use  `Extract<PossibleValues, {}>`.

```typescript
type NotNull = Extract<PossibleValues, {}>;
type NotNull = string | number | boolean;
```

We can use **{}** as the second argument to **Extract**  to match all types EXCEPT for  **null**  and  **undefined**. You can learn more in  [**this article**](https://www.totaltypescript.com/the-empty-object-type-in-typescript) on the empty object type.

## Find common members between two unions

In the following example, we have two union types: **EnglishSpeakingCountries**  and  **CountriesInWesternHemisphere**:

```typescript
type EnglishSpeakingCountries = "UK" | "USA" | "Canada";
type CountriesInWesternHemisphere = "USA" | "Canada" | "Mexico";
```

To find the common countries between these two unions, we can use the **Extract** utility type like this:

```typescript
type CommonCountries = Extract<
           type CommonCountries = "USA" | "Canada"  EnglishSpeakingCountries,
  CountriesInWesternHemisphere
>;
```

The resulting **CommonCountries** type will contain only the members that are present in both unions. In this case, the common country is "USA" as it exists in both unions.
