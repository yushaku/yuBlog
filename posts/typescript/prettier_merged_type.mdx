When working with intersection types in TypeScript, you might have noticed that hovering over the type doesn't show the complete expanded version. Here's a common example:

```ts
type Person = {
  name: string;
  age: string;
};

type Developer = Person & {
  tech: string;
};
```

Hovering over `Developer` in your IDE will typically show something like `Person & { tech: string }` rather than the complete flattened type.
This can be frustrating when you want to see all properties at once.

Here's a handy utility type that forces TypeScript to show the expanded version:

```ts
type Prettify<T> = {
  [K in keyof T]: T[K];
} & {};
```

Now let's apply it to our Developer type:

```ts {8-12}#s /Developer/#s
type Developer = Prettify<
  Person & {
    tech: string;
  }
>;

// Hovering now shows the complete type:
type Developer = {
  name: string;
  age: string;
  tech: string;
};
```

This approach works seamlessly with all **TypeScript utility** types like `Pick`, `Omit`, etc.:

```ts {8-11}#s /OmitPerson/#s
type OmitPerson = Prettify<
  Omit<Developer, "tech" | "age"> & {
    email: string;
  }
>;

// Hovering now shows the complete type:
type OmitPerson = {
  name: string;
  email: string;
};
```

  The Prettify type doesn't change the actual type behavior - it just makes the
  hover information more readable by forcing TypeScript to expand the type
  definition.

This is particularly useful when:

- Debugging complex types
- Working with large intersection types
- Sharing code with team members who need to understand your types quickly
