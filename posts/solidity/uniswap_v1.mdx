I have failed to understand how Uniswap works, cause i jump directly to the v3 codebase.
i think i need to understand the v1 codebase to understand the v3 codebase.

This article is inspired by [this uniswap book](https://uniswapv3book.com). And the v1 series are:

## Constant product market maker

You probably have already heard this definition, let's see what it means.

Automated market maker is a general term that embraces different decentralized market maker algorithms. The most popular ones (and those that gave birth to the term) are related to prediction markets - markets that allow to make profit on predictions. Uniswap and other on-chain exchanges are a continuation of those algorithms.

At the core of Uniswap is the constant product function:

$$
x * y = k
$$

Where $x$ is ether reserve, $y$ is token reserve (or vice versa), and $k$ is a constant. Uniswap requires that $k$ remains the same no matter how much of reserves of $x$ or $y$ there are.

When you trade ether for tokens you deposit your ethers into the contract and get some amount of tokens in return. Uniswap ensures that after each trade $k$ remains the same (this is not really true, we’ll see later why).

This formula is also responsible for pricing calculations, and we’ll soon see how.
