I've typed npm for the last time.

As JavaScript developers, we have four package managers to choose from.
And between personal, work, and open source projects, I use every last one of them.
This is a problem because typing the wrong command costs time and irritation.

Below is a zsh function that I've used to eliminate package manager context
switching heartache â€” typing npm start when we meant bun start or npm I when we mean shudders yarn.

```sh
function _package_manager() {
  if [[ -f bun.lockb ]]; then
    command bun "$@"
  elif [[ -f pnpm-lock.yaml ]]; then
		command pnpm "$@"
	elif [[ -f yarn.lock ]]; then
		command yarn "$@"
	elif [[ -f package-lock.json ]]; then
		command npm "$@"
	else
		command pnpm "$@"
	fi
}

alias p='_package_manager'
alias pi='_package_manager install'
alias pa='_package_manager add'
alias pad='_package_manager add -D'
alias prm='_package_manager remove'
alias pb='_package_manager build'
```
