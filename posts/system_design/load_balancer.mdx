Load balancing is a technique used to **distribute network traffic across a
pool of servers**. It optimizes network performance, reliability and capacity,
reducing latency as the demand is equally distributed among multiple servers
and compute resources.

## How Load Balancing Works

- Load balancing sit between the servers and the internet.
- handle incoming requests from users for information.
- Once a request is received, the load balancer first determines which server in a pool is available and online and then routes the request to that server.
- during times of heavy loads, a load balancer acts promptly and can _dynamically add servers in response to spikes in traffic_. conversely, load balancers _can drop servers if demand is low_.

## Benefits

1. **_Improved scalability_.**

   - Load balancers can scale the server infrastructure on demand, depending on the network requirements, without affecting services.
   - **For example**, if a website starts attracting a large number of visitors, it can _cause a sudden spike in traffic_. If the web server isn't able to manage this sudden influx of traffic, the _website might crash_. Load balancing can _spread the extra traffic across multiple servers_, preventing this from happening.

2. **_Improved efficiency._**

   - Due to the reduced burden of traffic on each server, the network traffic flows better and improves response times => This ultimately provides a better experience for site visitors.

3. **_Reduced downtime_.**

   - Companies with a global presence and multiple locations in different time zones can benefit from load balancing, especially when it comes to server maintenance.
   - For example, a company can shut down the server that needs maintenance and route traffic to the other available load balancers without causing service interruptions or [downtime](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/network-downtime).

4. **_Predictive analysis_**

   - Load balancing can _provide early detection of failures_ and help manage them without affecting other resources.
   - **For example**, software-based load balancers can predict traffic [bottlenecks](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/bottleneck) before they happen.

5. **_Efficient failure management_**

   - In the event of a failure, load balancers can automatically redirect traffic to functional resources and backup options.
   - **For example**, if a failure is detected on a network resource, such as a mail server, load balancers can redistribute resources to other unaffected areas to prevent service disruption.

6. **_Improved security_**
   - Load balancers add an _extra layer of security_ without requiring additional changes or resources.

## Algorithms

I found this blog explain the algorithms in a very detailed way:
[samwho/](https://samwho.dev/load-balancing/). i can't recommend it enough.
