## What is Redis?

Redis is an open-source, in-memory key-value data store known for its _speed_ and _flexibility_.

**Key Features**:

- **In-Memory Data Store**: Redis stores data in RAM, ensuring fast read and write speeds.
- **Data Persistence**: Unlike other in-memory caches, Redis can persist data to disk.
- **Rich Data Structures**: Redis is not limited to simple key-value pairs but offers robust structures such as lists, sets, sorted sets, and hashes.
- **Pub/Sub Messaging**: Redis allows message brokering using Pub/Sub, making it useful for real-time messaging systems.
- **Distributed System**: Redis supports clustering, enabling horizontal scalability.

## Why Redis?

Redis is a popular choice for many reasons:

- **High performance**: Redis is known for its high performance, which is due to its in-memory data storage and processing capabilities.
- **Scalability**: Redis is designed to be scalable, which means it can handle a large number of requests and data.
- **Flexibility**: Redis supports a variety of data structures, which makes it a versatile tool for many different use cases.

## Redis Internals: How Does It Work?

Redis is an in-memory data structure server. Let's break down the key components and internals of Redis:

### 1 Memory Management:

- Redis operates entirely in memory and uses a single-threaded event loop. Data is stored as key-value pairs in **RAM**, which ensures fast read/write performance.
- Redis leverages a **memory-efficient** representation called **SDS (Simple Dynamic String)** to store data.

### 2 Data Persistence:

Redis can persist data on disk using two primary mechanisms:

- **RDB (Redis Database)**: A point-in-time snapshot mechanism that saves data to disk at specific intervals.
- **AOF (Append Only File)**: Logs every write operation, making it more durable, though at the cost of speed compared to RDB.

### 3 Eviction Policies:

Since Redis operates in memory, it uses eviction policies to handle data when memory is full:

- **LRU (Least Recently Used)**: Removes the least recently accessed items.
- **LFU (Least Frequently Used)**: Removes items based on access frequency.
- **TTL (Time-to-Live)**: Allows setting expiration times for keys, making it easy to manage short-lived data.

## Redis Data Types

Redis supports five data types:

- Strings
- Hashes (Objects)
- Lists
- Sets
- Sorted Sets (Priority Queues)
- Geospatial Indexes
